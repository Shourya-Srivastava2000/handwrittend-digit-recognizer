I have tried to build a CNN deep network model
which is able to read the image of a digit and guess, given a certain confidence
level, what digit is in the photo.
I have also built a GUI which allows for an individual to draw a digit and
allows the computer to recognize it straight away using the model.
It uses the popular MNIST dataset  which contains 60,000 training images of
handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing.
